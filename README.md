# The bashrc directory is for scripts that are normally run in the ~/.bashrc file
To use these files add this line to the .bashrc file

	source <repo_dir>/bashrc/bashrc_login

May also need to run this on new servers
	git config --global user.email "mcunningham@themeetgroup.com"
	git config --global user.name "Michael Cunningham"
